- A folder for notebooks
- Reporting folder containing reporting 
- "models" folder for saved best performance models
- A folder "scripts" with data_utils module containing ETL and Embedding pipelines + two scripts for the two tested models (SiameseLSTM and BERTFineTuner)
- Env files (explained after)
